# Instructions  

Using Kaggle, find a dataset that you would like to explore and do an analysis of. Once you have found the dataset you want, upload the csv file here to your replit assignment. You will then download these files to vs code just like you did with our previous activity.

Once inside, use vscode to create a ".md" file that gives a brief explanation of why you chose this data set and lists out at least 10 questions about the dataset you hope to answer through your analysis. Once complete, commit your work to your github repository and submit your assignment on replit! 

NOTE : If you cannot find a dataset you fancy on Kaggle, it is alright to use another source to get the data. As long as you can find the data in a ".csv" format and the source can be trusted! (Wouldn't want you all out here using false / misrepresented data)

## Steps
No.| To Do
:-:|:-
1| Visit [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/) to find a dataset that you would like to explore
2| Be thoughtful and considerate when looking over the datasets on Kaggle. You want to be mindful of the type of analysis you're doing, the types of questions you want to answer when choosing your dataset!
3| Once you have found the dataset of your dreams, download the dataset's csv file onto your computer. NOTE : Another thing to watch for when selecting a dataset is if the data is spread across multiple csv files. It is best for you all to try to keep to datasets where everything is in one place / file
4| Upload the csv file you downloaded here to your replit work folder
5| Rename your "main.py" file to reflect the type of data you have found. For example, if I am uploading a csv that is about pokemon, I would rename my file to something like "pokemon_data.py"
6| On line 6 of the file you just renamed, change the variable name to be more representative of the type of data you have and change the string within the function to match the name of the csv file you just uploaded

  Use [Markdown](https://gist.github.com/cuonggt/9b7d08a597b167299f0d) to format your instructions.

  For example, here is a code block in python3
```python
def hello_world():
  print("hello world!")
```


  Include an image by placing it in the `assets` folder.

  For example, here is the Replit logo:
