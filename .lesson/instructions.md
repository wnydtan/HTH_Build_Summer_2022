# Instructions  

Let's just practice making variables and using data types in python. We will be creating variables to help describe ourselves.

## Steps
No.| To do
:-:|:-
1| In your "main.py" create a variable and give it a string value that holds your first and last name
2| Create another variable that holds your favorite nickname or preferred name
3| Create a variable that shows how old you are using a numeric data type
4| Have you used python before? Create a variable using the boolean data type to answer this question
5| Create a variable that is a list of your favorite hobbies
6| Create a dictionary that depicts your favorite things (movie, food, hobby, etc)

## Update: Testing and Github
Now that you have successfully made your first python file we need to save this file along with all our other work to a Github Repository. If you have not already, now would be a great time to create a github profile. Once you have done that, set up a new repository to store all of your work from your time in this program. 

Once you have your repo setup, rename your "main.py" file to something like "about_me.py". Also add this line of code to the very bottom of your "about_me" file:
```python
all_vars = dict(vars())
```
Afterward, create a new file called "about_me_test.py" and add the following code to it:
```python
from about_me import all_vars

print()
print("HERE IS WHERE THE TESTING OF OUR PROGRAM BEGINS")
print()
print()

''' MANUAL TESTING
'''

tested_variables = []

for var_name, var in all_vars.items():

  if "__" not in var_name and var_name != "key":
    tested_variables.append((var_name, var))

print(f"Here are your variables that will be tested: {tested_variables}")

if type(tested_variables[0][1]) != type(''):
  raise Exception("Your name should be a string")

if type(tested_variables[1][1]) != type(''):
  raise Exception("Your nickname should be a string")

if type(tested_variables[2][1]) != type(0):
  raise Exception("Your age should be an integer!")

if type(tested_variables[3][1]) != type(True):
  raise Exception("You should be using a boolean (true or false) to say whether or not you have used Python before")

if type(tested_variables[4][1]) != type([]):
  raise Exception("You should have included a list of multiple hobbies you enjoy")

if type(tested_variables[5][1]) != type({}):
  raise Exception("You favorite things should be a dictionary")

''' Pytest TESTING
'''

import unittest

class TestAboutMe(unittest.TestCase):
  def test_variable_types(self):
    self.assertEqual(type(tested_variables[0][1]), type(''))
    self.assertEqual(type(tested_variables[1][1]), type(''))
    self.assertEqual(type(tested_variables[2][1]), type(0))
    self.assertEqual(type(tested_variables[3][1]), type(True))
    self.assertEqual(type(tested_variables[4][1]), type([]))
    self.assertEqual(type(tested_variables[5][1]), type({}))

print()
print("ALL TEST PASSED")
```

You can now download your files using the button to the left of Replit's interface. You can place the unzipped folder into your github repo ( I will show you how to do this so don't worry!) 

## Other
  Use [Markdown](https://gist.github.com/cuonggt/9b7d08a597b167299f0d) to format your instructions.

  For example, here is a code block in python3
```python
def hello_world():
  print("hello world!")
```


  Include an image by placing it in the `assets` folder.

  For example, here is the Replit logo:
