# Instructions  

Here we have a dataset that has information about all the passengers who were abroad the tragic voyage of the Titanic. Here is a description of the features in this data:

VARIABLE | DESCRIPTION
:-:|:-
survival | Did the passenger survive the collision and rescue? (0 = No ; 1 = Yes)
pclass | In what class was the passenger traveling? (1 = 1st ; 2 = 2nd ; 3 = 3rd)
name | Passenger's name
sex | Passenger's gender
age | Passenger's age
sibsp | Number of siblings/spouses that were aboard with the passenger
parch | Number of parents/children that were aboard with the passenger
ticket | Passenger's ticket number
fare | Price the passenger paid for their ticket
cabin | Cabin of the ship where the passenger is lodging
embarked | Port where the passenger boarded the Titanic (C = Cherbourg ; Q = Queenstown ; S = Southampton)

Follow the instructions to use your new knowledge of Python's Pandas library to manipulate the data and answer the prompts.

## Steps
No.| To Do
:-:|:-
1| Use the appropriate pandas method to read the titanic data into your python file
2| Use the appropriate pandas method to read the first and last 25 lines of the dataset
3| Use the pandas method that only tells us the number of rows and columns in our data
4| Use pandas to describe the titanic dataset
5| Use pandas data manipulation techniques to figure out how many passengers were between the ages of 0 to 16? 17 to 25? 26 to 40? 41 to 59? Older than 60?
6| Find the number of missing values in the "age" column of the dataset
7| List out all the available passengers' ages
8| Filter the DataFrame to find all passengers who boarded the Titanic at Port Cherbourg
9| Can you find the average age of both male and female passengers?
10| Can you find the percentage of survivors from the three different embarked groups?

Once you have completed all the steps above, you can download this replit assignment into your program work folder and upload it to your github repo. Finally, submit the assignment here and on google classroom.
